My hobby is RallyCross racing. Rally is when you race cars on dirt roads at high speeds. There are two sections of Rally; Stage Rally and RallyCross. Stage Rally is when you race against the clock on dirt roads usually though the woods. RallyCross is where you race against the clock but it's on a track drawn out in a field or dirt parking lot using cones. RallyCross is much safer and cheaper than Stage Rally. I would like to be come a Stage racer some day but for now I don't have the funds, or the experience.
Below is a picture of me at a RallyCross race and a highlight movie from the World Rally Championship which is a stage rally.

Enjoy!
