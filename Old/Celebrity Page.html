  <td align="left"><font color="FFFFFF">Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays power forward for the Boston Celtics . After a high school basketball career at Farragut Career Academy which included winning a national player of the year award, he skipped college and entered the NBA Draft. He was selected with the 5th overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years.
 <br>
 <br>

Garnett made an immediate impact with the Minnesota Timberwolves leading them to eight-consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, Garnett led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals and was voted Most Valuable Player in the 2003–04 season. In the 2000 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the USA men's national basketball team. Since his second season in the league, Garnett has been named to every All-Star Game, which includes winning the All-Star MVP award in 2003. He was awarded the regular season's NBA Defensive Player of the Year in the 2007–08 season and has been a nine-time member of the All-NBA Teams selection and a ten-time member of the All-Defensive Teams selection. Garnett currently holds several all-time Timberwolves franchise records.
<br>
<br>

After spending 12 seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Garnett went to the Boston Celtics in a blockbuster trade. In his first year with the Celtics, he helped them win their first NBA championship since 1986 and the Celtics' seventeenth title.

  <td align="left"><font color="FFFFFF">The Boston Celtics are a professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the Eastern Conference of the NBA. Founded in 1946, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C. The Celtics' 17 NBA Championships  are the most for any NBA franchise. From 1957 to 1969, the Celtics dominated the league winning 11 championships in 13 years, and eight in a row (1959–1966), the longest consecutive championship winning streak of any North American professional sports team.
<br>
<br>
The Celtics either dominated the league or played a large part in the playoffs starting in the late 50's and continuing through the mid 80's (winning 16 NBA Championships in 30 years between 1957 and 1986, and reaching at least the conference championship series in 29 of 35 seasons between 1953 and 1988). With the deaths of second overall draft pick Len Bias in 1986 and all-star Reggie Lewis in 1993, the team fell into a steady decline, only making the playoffs five times from 1993 to 2007. The franchise returned to prominence in 2007 when Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen joined Paul Pierce and led the team to its 17th championship.
