This is my page about me. I am a sophomore at Endicott College. I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Interactive Technologies. Although I am a sophomore most of my classes are freshman classes because I was an Athletic Training major last year. I am really happy I switched to computer science and I plan on staying here.</p>
<p> I grew up in a small town in New Hampshire. I loved living there. Something about the small town atmosphere mad me really happy. Everybody knows everyone else and it really felt like a community. I went to a small school. My graduating class had only 46 students. The whole school itself is only about 350.

I played 2 sports in high school, Soccer and basketball. I loved them both. The feeling of being on a team and playing with other people seemed to renew me. I am also very competitive. Although I was a "jock" in school, I also was on the computer tech staff for 3 years. There I learned alot about computers and it really sparked my interest in them.</p></font>

I have a very large family. There are 7 of us in my house. I have 4 siblings. Their names are: 
<ul>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Elijah</li>
<li>Jordan</li>
<li>Valarie</li>
</ul>
<br>
Together we are one big happy family</h3>
