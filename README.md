convert my inventory management program from c# to a web app with a mobile feature for reservations. 
Program will be able to reserve equipment based on a table that checks if the equipment has already been reserved or is not available. 
Program will be able to check eqipemnt in and out of an invenotry based on barcodes through an admin only webpage.
